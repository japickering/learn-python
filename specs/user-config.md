# Build a User Configuration Manager

[Python User Configuration Manager](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-v9/lab-user-configuration-manager/build-a-user-configuration-manager)

## Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

### User Stories:

1. You should define a function named `add_setting` with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a tuple containing a key-value pair.

2. `add_setting` function should:

- Convert the key and value to lowercase.
- If the key setting exists, return `Setting '[key]' already exists! Cannot add a new setting with this name.`
- If the key setting doesn't exist, add the key-value pair to the given dictionary of settings and return `Setting '[key]' added with value '[value]' successfully!.`
- The messages returned should have the key and value in lowercase.

3. You should define a function named `update_setting` with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a tuple containing a key-value pair.

4. `update_setting` function should:

- Convert the key and value to lowercase.
- If the key setting exists, update its value in the given dictionary of settings and return: Setting '[key]' updated to '[value]' successfully!
- If the key setting doesn't exist, return `Setting '[key]' does not exist! Cannot update a non-existing setting.`
- The messages returned should have the key and value in lowercase.

5. You should define a function named `delete_setting` with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a key.

6. `delete_setting` function should:

- Convert the key passed to lowercase.
- If the key setting exists, remove the key-value pair from the given dictionary of settings and return Setting '[key]' deleted successfully!
- If the key setting does not exist, return `Setting not found!`
- The messages returned should have the key in lowercase.

7. You should define a function named `view_settings` with one parameter representing a dictionary of settings.

8. `view_settings` function should:

- Return No settings available. if the given dictionary of settings is empty.
- If the dictionary contains any settings, return a string displaying the settings. The string should start with `Current User Settings:` followed by the key-value pairs, each on a new line and with the key capitalized.

For example, `view_settings({'theme': 'dark', 'notifications': 'enabled', 'volume': 'high'})` should return:

```
Current User Settings:
Theme: dark
Notifications: enabled
Volume: high
```

9. For testing the code, you should create a dictionary named `test_settings` to store some user configuration preferences.
